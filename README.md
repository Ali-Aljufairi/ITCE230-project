### Private  Parking Car system

The private parking system is a special system for creating parking spaces to a specific facility. It is so important to homes, hotels, hospitals, and villas, etc. to protect their cars and vehicles. First thing comes in the mind is about how I protect cars and vehicle from steal and theft. Most of the cases, they are using a normal parking which is increase the theft rate and nothing protect cars and vehicles from the thief. There are only cameras and maybe a guard but that not enough for protecting and keep the cars safe.
